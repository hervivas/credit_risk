The aim of this project is to asses the effectiveness of different models in predicting home credit default. We will use Kaggle's Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability dataset available [here](www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability/data). We are not concern with the Credit Risk Model Stability problem itself, we will just use the dataset.
